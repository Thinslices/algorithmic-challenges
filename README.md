# Algorithmic Challenges

Welcome to the `algorithmic-challenges` repository, a collaborative space for practicing problem-solving techniques related to algorithms, data structures, and computing problems. This repository is designed for both personal improvement and team collaboration on algorithmic challenges.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a structured environment where you can enhance your programming and algorithmic problem-solving skills. It offers a collection of challenges ranging from basic data structures to complex algorithmic problems to work on individually or discuss as a group.

## Repository Structure

- `/challenges`: This folder contains all the algorithmic challenges posted as markdown files. Each challenge includes a description, example inputs and outputs, and any special instructions.
- `/techniques`: A dedicated folder offering insights into various problem-solving techniques. This section includes README.md files that explain different approaches and methods for tackling algorithmic problems effectively.

## Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/challenges` directory to explore available challenges.

### Working on a Challenge

1. Create a long-term branch from `main` using your initials. For example, if your name is Bogdan Balan, your branch would be named `bb`.
2. You are free to solve challenges using any programming language of your choice. This flexibility ensures you can work in a language you are comfortable with or explore new ones.
3. For each challenge you solve, include unit tests to verify your solution. This is crucial for ensuring the correctness of your code and facilitating easier reviews and collaboration.
4. Commit your solutions and associated unit tests to your personal branch. Be sure to include comments or README files in your solutions to explain your approach and any relevant details.

### Best Practices

- **Commit Often**: Make small, incremental commits with clear messages that explain what you have done.
- **Include Unit Tests**: Ensure each challenge solution is accompanied by thorough unit tests. This not only validates your solution but also assists in the review process.
- **Continuous Learning**: Use this repository as a learning tool. Explore different solutions to the same problem and discuss these approaches with colleagues.

### Contributions

While the main branch is protected to maintain the integrity of challenge descriptions and repository structure, contributions of new challenges or improvements to existing ones are welcome through pull requests.

1. To contribute a new challenge, please follow the markdown format used in the `/challenges` directory.
2. Ensure your challenge includes a clear problem statement, example inputs and outputs, and any constraints or special instructions.
3. Open a pull request with your challenge for review.

## Collaboration

- **Pulling from Main**: Regularly pull from the main branch to your personal branch to stay up-to-date with new challenges and updates.
